### Introduction/Background 

Climate change is currently one of the world’s most pressing problems. When looking at CO2 emissions specifically, transportation is the biggest contributor, making up 28% overall [1]. In fact, the City of Atlanta experienced an 84% overall increase in transportation CO2 emissions since 1990 [2]. To curtail this, the Enivronmental Protection annually imposes a reducing CO2 emission limit. However, some car manufacturers, like Volkswagen, has seen emission increases due to a “large shift towards sport utility vehicles (SUVs)” [3]. Therefore, to meet the hard standard, millions of dollars are invested to make vehicle engines more fuel efficient, but several automotive companies have additionally invested in developing electric vehicles (EVs). With rising EV popularity, we expect a correlation between increasing EV sales with decreasing transportation CO2 emissions.  

### Problem Definition

Due to EVs playing a seemingly vital role in reducing emissions, this project will develop a correlation between yearly EV sales to yearly transportation CO2 emissions to predict future CO2 emissions based off future EV sales. Therefore, the project will also give a prediction of future EV sales for current and upcoming models based on past sales trends. Specifically, these predictions will be performed for individual US states to determine which states will experience the largest increases or decreases of emission levels over the next 5 years. This will be followed by subsequent grouping of the states into high or low risk categories. 

### Methods

For this project, we will be analyzing two types of datasets for each US state: 1) yearly CO2 emission levels 2) yearly EV sales. We will then perform a comparative analysis between the CO2 levels for a calendar year and the corresponding EV sales. We will also perform a regression analysis on the data and use it to predict CO2 levels and EV sales for future years. This is to determine whether increase in EV sales really correspond to decreases in CO2 levels. We will also be using clustering analysis to designate states into emission level categories (e.g. high vs low) and mark the states with high emissions as potential areas to promote EV sales.  

### Potential Results

This project is relating EV sales to transportation CO2 emissions, so potential results include predictions of future EV sales and their subsequent CO2 emissions for future years. This predictive model will be used for specific states within the United States. In addition, another result could be another predictive model that predicts the number of EVs sold for each future year when given a desired CO2 emission for a future date. Another result would be the grouping of states based on their transportation CO2 emissions and EV sales, which will ultimately highlight target regions for improving green transportation. Ultimately, these results will help map out the future role EVs need to play in the fight to curtail CO2 emissions.

### Discussion

For this project, we are trying to predict future yearly EV sales and subsequent CO2 emissions for individual US states. Therefore, a regression analysis will be performed on yearly transportation CO2 emissions and electric vehicle sales over the past 10 years, which brings forth a potential problem: Increasing EV sales may not correlate to decreasing transportation CO2 emissions, because EV sales are largely residential while commercial vehicles (trucks, buses, etc.) also play a big role in CO2 emissions. To help solve this, we may use current EV sales trends to predict the future sales of upcoming commercial EVs, such as Tesla’s Cybertruck, and their subsequent emissions impact. In addition, EV sales do not have a long history with recorded sales starting in 2010, so future predictions will only rely on yearly trends over 10 years.
