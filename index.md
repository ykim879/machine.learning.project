### Introduction/Background 

Lowering CO2 emission is one of the most pressing struggles in the automotive industry, where there is a maximum CO2 emission limit imposed by the Environment Protection Agency that gets further reduced every calendar year. To meet the increasingly hard standards, millions of dollars are invested to make vehicle engines more fuel efficient. To combat the carbon impact of the Transportation industry, several automotive companies have invested in creating electric vehicles. Recent environmental decisions have raised the limit on CO2 emissions within the United States, but with an increase in electric vehicle popularity, there should be a correlation between the increase in vehicle sales and decrease in CO2 emissions. 

### Problem Definition
This project is analyzing a correlation between sales of electric vehicles and emissions of CO2 levels. Depending on the increased sales of electric vehicles, this project shows the resulting CO2 emission. The project will also give the prediction of future CO2 emission by analyzing the sales tendency. This prediction will find the states with the largest increase and decrease of emission levels within 5 years. Moreover, this projects group high-risk states and low risk states according to CO2 levels. 

### Methods
For this project, we will be looking at the datasets that presents data on CO2 emission levels year wise and electric car sales per year and then perform a comparative analysis between the CO2 levels during the year and the electric car sales for that year. We are also planning to do a regression analysis of what the predicted CO2 level and electric car sales are and see whether the CO2 level decrease with increase in sales for electric cars. We will also be clustering states into higher emission levels and lower emission levels and mark the states where there is high risk as a potential target places to promote EV car sales. 

### Potential Results
This project is relating electric vehicle (EV) sales and registration to transportation CO2 emissions, so potential results include using past trends in EV sales and CO2 emissions to predict transportation CO2 emissions for future years. This predictive model will be used for specific regions within the United States and potentially the European Union (i.e. states and countries respectively). In addition, another result could be another predictive model that predicts the number of EVs sold for each future year when given a desired CO2 emission for a future date. Ultimately, these results will help map out the future role EVs need to play in the fight to curtail CO2 emissions.
